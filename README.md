# *HD-irSDR*: An Integrative Dimension Reduction Approach for High-dimensional Multi-source Data

Maintainer: Wei Qian <weiqian@udel.edu>

### Description

HD-irSDR is a high-dimensional sufficient dimension reduction method for integrative analysis with sparsity learning. It aims to extract sufficient information in supervised fashion to achieve dimension reduction and variable selection for multi-source data simultaneously. This repo contains a MATLAB demo and implementation of HD-irSDR algorithm. 

Detailed description of *HD-irSDR* is given in a technical report shown below.
